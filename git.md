# The Git Commit Pattern
* `git status` _type this first to double check that you haven't changed anything you don't want to save_
* `git add .` _add all the files that we changed in some way_
* `git commit -m "Your message here"` _Add a note to your future self about what you did so if you had to roll back, you know what happened in this change_
