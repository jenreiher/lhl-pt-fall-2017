*Words we learned so far:*

* __Stack__: the different technologies and languages to a working web application. Different companies have different "stacks".
* __Git__: a type of version control that allows us to track changes and go back to previous versions.
* __Boilerplate__: a basic set up to work with for any particular web app framework (e.g. Sinatra). 
* __The Cloud__: the cloud is essentially a computer that holds other 'virtual' computers within it. This is possible because computer processing power is powerful enough that we are able to split up a processor into several 'smaller virtual processors'.
* __ merge conflict __: when git gets angry at your bad habits.
